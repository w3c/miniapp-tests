# Test repository for the MiniApp specifications

This repository contains tests to validate the implementations of the W3C's MiniApp specifications, specifically [MiniApp Packaging](https://www.w3.org/TR/miniapp-packaging/) (the spec for the MiniApp format itself), [MiniApp Manifest](https://www.w3.org/TR/miniapp-manifest/) (the spec to define a MiniApp and its configuration), and [MiniApp Lifecycle](https://www.w3.org/TR/miniapp-lifecycle/) (the spec that defines the events and APIs to control the execution lifecycle of a MiniApp). Our
objective is to test every normative statement (that is, every
[`MUST` or `SHOULD` or `MAY`](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp14), etc.).

The [test reports](https://w3c.github.io/miniapp-tests/) describe all the tests, including
[implementation results](https://w3c.github.io/miniapp-tests/results) and
[how to contribute](https://w3c.github.io/miniapp-tests/contributing).

## Acknowledgements

This testing methodology is based on the [EPUB tests](https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/), generated and maintained by the [EPUB 3 Working Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/epub-wg/). So, a big thanks to [Ivan Herman](https://www.w3.org/People/Ivan/), Dan Lazin, and the rest of [the group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/epub-wg/).
